# Machine Learning Based Detection Of ASL(American Sign Language) Gestures

# ONLY 3 THINGS YOU NEED

    1. Dataset (Here, it is a link: https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)
    2. Model (We are using Convolution Neural Network(CNN))
    3. Platform (OpenCV)
    
# Run This File
    Before run this file, you need to download Dataset from kaggle.
    
    First, Train the model cnn.py file
    
    Second, Run this classify.py to see the output
    
You should put hand appropriately to see Output of Gesture. You can find amer_sign3.png.
